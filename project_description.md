[Atacmonitor](www.atacmonitor.com) measures the performance of public transport in Rome. It collects every 3 minutes the waiting times at more than 500 stations within the city. The project is open source and is already running on AWS and MongoDB Atlas cloud platforms.

You can join the project by working on one of the following areas according to your preferences:

- __data ingestion:__ improve the data ingestion job. Example: extend the data collection to the entire set of stations (+7k).
- __stream processing:__ build event-based real time alerts. Example: build a Twitter bot that tweets anomalies like waiting time larger than 1h!
- __data mining:__ define KPIs and detect patterns within the data. Example: is there any day of the week where the waiting time is significantly higher?
- __data visualization:__ build an interactive dashboard to combine time series and topographical data. Example: are the waiting times similar in city center and in suburbs?
